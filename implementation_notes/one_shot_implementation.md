# One-Shot Port Implementation Notes

## Approved Goal

Fully implement pychete's one-shot Matchete-style one-loop matching port on the
`one-shot-port` branch. The objective is to make pychete capable of performing
one-loop EFT matching for the Matchete validation target models, especially
SMEFT UV-complete matching models, while preserving pychete's Pythonic API and
using Symbolica/idenso/spenso/vakint as the computational backends instead of
reimplementing symbolic physics algorithms in Python.

Very important: use Symbolica as much as possible and periodically rescan the
Symbolica Python stub files so the native API stays in context.

Normal pychete tests must be Mathematica-independent. pytest must never require
Mathematica, `wolframscript`, or a runnable Matchete installation. Development
helper Wolfram scripts may load the read-only Matchete checkout to generate
committed pychete-owned fixtures, but runtime code and tests must load only
those fixtures.

Keep the approved implementation plan copied into both
`implementation_notes/one_shot_user.md` and
`implementation_notes/one_shot_implementation.md`, and keep both copies updated
whenever the plan changes. Keep this implementation note continuously updated
with current progress, completed milestones, test status, backend/API
discoveries, dependency patches, blockers, and remaining work.

## Approved Plan

# One-Shot One-Loop Matching Port

## Summary

- Build a Pythonic pychete implementation of Matchete-style one-loop matching,
  prioritizing the default SMEFT UV matching models first, then all Matchete
  validation tests that map cleanly to pychete's architecture.
- Normal pytest must be Mathematica-independent. Development-only Wolfram
  scripts may load Matchete to generate serialized pychete fixtures under the
  repo, but tests load only those committed fixtures.
- Use Symbolica as the symbolic engine, idenso/spenso for gamma, colour,
  metric, and tensor algebra, and vakint for vacuum integral canonicalization,
  tensor reduction, and evaluation.
- Compare results by pychete canonical equality, backed by Symbolica evaluator
  numeric probes for hard-to-canonicalize expressions.

## Key Changes

- Add `helper_mathematica_scripts/` with Wolfram scripts that load Matchete and
  export model definitions, validation expected outputs, supertraces, matching
  conditions, and selected unit-test fixtures into pychete-owned serialized
  assets.
- Add committed fixture assets for Matchete-independent pytest validation;
  never require `wolframscript` in normal tests.
- Extend pychete metadata with gauge groups, representations, CG tensors,
  charges, chiral fermions, ghosts, Goldstones, background fields, coupling
  symmetries, diagonal/unitary metadata, and SMEFT basis metadata using
  Symbolica symbol tags/data.
- Replace the current tiny Mathematica loader as a validation path with fixture
  loading; keep any direct Mathematica-input support explicitly secondary.

## Matching Engine

- Add a one-loop matching API around `Theory.match(..., loop_order=1)` returning
  a structured `MatchingResult` with UV Lagrangian, fluctuation operators,
  individual supertraces, off-shell EFT Lagrangian, on-shell EFT Lagrangian, and
  matching conditions.
- Implement the Matchete pipeline in pychete terms: free Lagrangian
  construction, Feynman rules/functional derivatives, fluctuation-operator
  extraction, heavy/light DoF classification, propagator expansion, supertrace
  generation, loop-momentum tensor reduction, integral evaluation, EFT
  truncation, EOM/on-shell reduction, and effective-coupling mapping.
- Use Symbolica patterns, `replace_multiple`, `series`, `coefficient`,
  `collect`, `derivative`, `Transformer`, and evaluator APIs before adding
  Python traversal logic.
- Route gamma/colour/metric simplification through idenso adapters,
  tensor/CG contraction through spenso adapters, and vacuum integrals through
  vakint adapters.
- If idenso/spenso/vakint are insufficient, add patch files under
  `dependencies/patches/`, make `dependencies/install_dependencies.py` apply
  them after clone/reset and before build, and test the patched behavior from
  Python.

## Validation And Tests

- First green milestone: fixture-generation scripts plus committed fixtures for
  the default integration models: `VLF_toy_model`,
  `Singlet_Scalar_Extension`, `E_VLL`, and `S1S3LQs`.
- Then port mappable unit validations for definitions, covariant derivatives,
  EFT counting, Feynman rules, loop integration, Dirac/NCM algebra,
  simplifications, coupling manipulation, flavor/group/CG behavior, SSB, and
  dimensional reduction.
- Exclude tests that only assert Matchete's internal structure, caching,
  package globals, print forms, or Mathematica-specific behavior with a
  documented skip map.
- For every symbolic equality test, canonicalize with
  pychete/Symbolica/idenso/spenso/vakint; where canonical equality is fragile,
  add Symbolica `Evaluator`-based numeric probes with deterministic sample
  points.
- Keep `pytest` and `mypy` green at each committed milestone.

## Workflow

- During implementation, create and maintain
  `implementation_notes/one_shot_user.md` and
  `implementation_notes/one_shot_implementation.md`.
- Commit and push only green, coherent milestones to remote branch
  `one-shot-port`.
- Preserve the existing public API discipline: intended user APIs are exported
  through `pychete.api` and package root `pychete`, with docstrings and Jupyter
  `_repr_html_` / `_repr_latex_` where relevant.

## Assumptions

- Public API should remain Pythonic pychete, with Matchete-inspired helpers only
  where they reduce friction.
- Pytest must not depend on Mathematica, Matchete runtime loading, or
  `wolframscript`.
- Full validation means "all tests that map to pychete's implementation model,"
  with one-loop SMEFT matching treated as the primary acceptance target.

## Live Progress

- Current branch: `one-shot-port`.
- Current baseline commit at start of one-shot implementation: `a8abd5c`.
- The Matchete reference checkout exists under `Mathematica_reference/Matchete`
  and is treated as read-only.
- Completed the first implementation slice:
  - recorded the approved plan in both one-shot notes;
  - added a Mathematica-independent validation fixture loader backed by
    `PycheteState`;
  - added the default Matchete matching target manifest for
    `VLF_toy_model`, `Singlet_Scalar_Extension`, `E_VLL`, and `S1S3LQs`;
  - added development-only Mathematica helper script scaffolding for raw
    Matchete matching snapshots.
- Completed the second implementation slice:
  - added public `MatchingResult` as the structured carrier for UV Lagrangian,
    fluctuation operators, individual supertraces, off-shell EFT Lagrangian,
    on-shell EFT Lagrangian, matching conditions, and metadata;
  - added validation fixture support for reconstructing `MatchingResult` from
    committed JSON expression references;
  - kept `load_validation_fixture` out of the package-root public API while
    promoting `MatchingResult` as a public result object;
  - added Jupyter repr coverage for `MatchingResult`.
- Completed the third implementation slice:
  - added `pychete.validation.evaluator_probe_equal`, which compares two
    expressions through `Expression.evaluator_multiple` rather than Python-side
    substitution;
  - added `NumericProbeResult` to carry equality, maximum absolute difference,
    and per-sample differences;
  - added NumPy to the managed dependency bootstrap because Symbolica evaluator
    calls require the NumPy array API at runtime;
  - pinned the managed NumPy dependency to `numpy<2.5` because NumPy 2.5 stubs
    require Python 3.12 syntax while pychete's mypy target is Python 3.11.
- Completed the fourth implementation slice:
  - added `FieldChirality` and stored field chirality in Symbolica symbol data;
  - added field gauge-charge metadata stored in Symbolica symbol data;
  - added `Theory.group_charge(...)` for Pythonic U(1)-charge construction;
  - taught the supported Matchete model loader path to preserve simple
    `Charges`, `Indices`, and `Chiral` field options;
  - updated the VLF toy model Python asset so the Python and supported
    Mathematica assets agree on U(1) charge metadata.

## Backend/API Discoveries

- Symbolica state restoration already supports the structural guarantee needed
  for validation fixtures: `PycheteState.from_json_obj` restores registered
  theory symbols before parsing stored expressions.
- Existing idenso APIs include direct gamma, colour, metric, index wrapping, and
  dangling-index routines; these should be the first line for algebra adapters.
- Existing vakint APIs include `to_canonical`, `tensor_reduce`,
  `evaluate_integral`, and `evaluate`, which map directly onto the planned loop
  integral backend.
- Rescanned the Symbolica Python stub sections for `Expression.match`,
  `Expression.matches`, `Expression.evaluator`, and `Expression.evaluator_multiple`.
  The numeric-probe validation layer should use these evaluator APIs rather than
  Python substitution/evaluation.
- Directly tested `Expression.evaluator` and `Expression.evaluator_multiple` in
  the managed venv. Both return NumPy arrays; without NumPy installed the
  Symbolica evaluator path aborts before Python can raise a normal exception.
- Matchete `DefineField` stores `Charges`, `Indices`, and `Chiral` as first-class
  field options. The pychete representation now persists the first simple slice
  of that metadata through Symbolica symbol data and JSON checkpoints.

## Remaining Work

- Add committed validation fixture assets for the four default Matchete matching
  integration models.
- Convert raw Matchete snapshots into pychete-owned fixture JSON that pytest can
  consume without Mathematica.
- Add the first real matching-result fixture asset using the `MatchingResult`
  fixture schema.
- Use `evaluator_probe_equal` in fixture comparison tests when canonical
  equality is insufficient.
- Extend field metadata further for background fields, Goldstones, ghosts,
  representation reality, and SMEFT basis data.
- Extend the theory metadata and matching engine toward one-loop matching.
