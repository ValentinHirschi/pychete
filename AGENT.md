# pychete Agent Notes

## Running Tests

Install the managed dependencies first:

```sh
python dependencies/install_dependencies.py
```

For a faster setup that skips the slow GammaLoop API build:

```sh
python dependencies/install_dependencies.py --no-gammaloop
```

Then run the test suite with pytest from the managed virtual environment:

```sh
source dependencies/.venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests
```

Equivalently, without activating the environment:

```sh
dependencies/.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests
```

## Dependency Policy

Using `sympy` and `scipy` is strictly forbidden in this project, including
importing them. All symbolic, algebraic, tensor, and integral work must be done
with Symbolica and the locally built community modules as much as possible.

Use:

- Symbolica for all symbolic and algebraic manipulations.
- idenso for gamma-matrix and colour algebra.
- spenso for tensor-network evaluations when needed.
- vakint for integration and pole identification of massive vacuum integrals.

The installer builds the GammaLoop API against the local Symbolica checkout
with Symbolica's `gmp` feature enabled. GMP is an accepted dependency for this
project.

## API Discovery

The local source checkouts under `dependencies/` are the primary API reference.
Inspect implementation details directly in:

- `dependencies/symbolica/src/`
- `dependencies/gammaloop/crates/idenso/`
- `dependencies/gammaloop/crates/spenso/`
- `dependencies/gammaloop/crates/spynso3/`
- `dependencies/gammaloop/crates/vakint/`
- `dependencies/gammaloop/crates/gammaloop-api/`

For Python-facing APIs, also inspect the generated/source stub files:

- `dependencies/symbolica-community/python/symbolica/core.pyi`
- `dependencies/symbolica-community/python/symbolica/community/idenso/__init__.pyi`
- `dependencies/symbolica-community/python/symbolica/community/spenso/__init__.pyi`
- `dependencies/symbolica-community/python/symbolica/community/vakint/__init__.pyi`

For GammaLoop's Python API, inspect:

- `dependencies/gammaloop/crates/gammaloop-api/python/gammaloop/__init__.py`
- `dependencies/gammaloop/crates/gammaloop-api/src/python.rs`
